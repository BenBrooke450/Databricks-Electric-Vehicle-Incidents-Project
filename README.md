# Crime in the City of London

The City of London, often referred to simply as "the City" or "the Square Mile," is located in the heart of Greater London. It's a distinct and historic part of London that has its own local authority, the City of London Corporation. The City is roughly one square mile in area, which is where it gets its nickname.

The first modern police force in the world was established in London in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel. This force, known as the Metropolitan Police Service, was created to address the growing need for organized law enforcement in the rapidly expanding city. The officers were often referred to as "Bobbies" or "Peelers" after Sir Robert Peel.

Before the establishment of the Metropolitan Police, law enforcement in Britain relied on local constables and night watchmen. For example, the Bow Street Runners, founded in 1749 by magistrate Henry Fielding, were an early form of organized policing in London
