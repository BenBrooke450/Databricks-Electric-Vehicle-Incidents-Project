## Project Description

This project leverages Databricks and Azure to build a data processing system for analyzing electric car sales and accidents in the UK. The system employs a medallion architecture pipeline to efficiently process and analyze data, providing valuable insights into the trends and patterns of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and safety.

## Key Features

Data Ingestion: Utilizes Databricks to extract data from various sources, including sales records, accident reports, and external datasets.

Data Transformation: Cleanses and transforms the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy, using Azure Databricks' powerful processing capabilities.

Data Storage: Stores the transformed data in a scalable and secure Azure data lake for easy access and querying.

Data Analysis: Performs comprehensive analyses on the data to identify key trends and patterns in EV sales and accidents, using Databricks' advanced analytics tools.

Visualization: Presents the analysis results through intuitive and interactive visualizations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
